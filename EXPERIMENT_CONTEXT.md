# CB-Whisper Experiment Context

## Current Task

We are running metric-improvement experiments on the original CB-Whisper codebase. The main research direction is to improve CB-Whisper itself, especially contextual prompting, decoding, n-best rescoring, phonetic matching, candidate selection, repair, and evaluation logic.

The current work is not focused on retraining or replacing the KWS model. KWS is treated as a controlled component unless an experiment is explicitly designed to study KWS.

## Environment

Use the conda environment at:

```text
/root/autodl-tmp/great
```

Do not run experiments in the base environment. Use this Python when launching code:

```text
/root/autodl-tmp/great/bin/python
```

The main experiment config is:

```text
src/configs/cb-whisper-aishell.yaml
```

The Whisper large-v3 adaptation config is:

```text
src/configs/cb-whisper-aishell-v3.yaml
```

Use the v3 config for a separate v2-vs-v3 comparison. Do not overwrite the v2 config, because the accepted nested long-hotword promotion result is currently tied to the large-v2 baseline.

Typical test command shape:

```bash
cd /root/autodl-tmp/src
TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=error \
CBW_DEBUG_LOG=logs/runtime_probe.jsonl \
CBW_DEBUG_MAX_SAMPLES=100 \
CBW_DEBUG_CLEAR_ON_START=1 \
CBW_METRICS_OUT=logs/test_metrics.csv \
/root/autodl-tmp/great/bin/python cb-whisper.py test --config configs/cb-whisper-aishell.yaml
```

## Fixed KWS Checkpoint

Keep this KWS checkpoint fixed unless the experiment is explicitly about KWS modification:

```text
/root/autodl-tmp/src/mlruns/641753688314575260/d9b9fafe87d64bc98400705d2c58525c/checkpoints/f1G-epoch=7-step=48040.ckpt
```

This checkpoint is currently considered the best available KWS model from prior local experiments. It already improves over the original CB-Whisper KWS setup, so changing it would confound CB-Whisper-side experiments.

For large-v3 experiments, keep this KWS checkpoint and the KWS encoder setting fixed. The v3 adaptation should initially change only the ASR generator/processor checkpoint from `openai/whisper-large-v2` to `openai/whisper-large-v3`.

## Research Constraints

CB-Whisper is intended to be a lightweight improvement over Whisper. New methods should preserve that spirit.

Acceptable directions:

- Lightweight contextual prompting changes.
- Lightweight n-best reranking or rescoring.
- Phonetic or lexical scoring that is explainable and cheap.
- Clean candidate selection rules with defensible motivation.
- Paper-friendly methods that can be described as a general algorithm.

Avoid:

- Much longer recognition passes as a final method.
- Many repeated ASR calls per utterance.
- Heavy external models.
- Case-specific patches tuned only to observed errors.
- Overly engineered post-processing that is hard to justify in a paper.

## Main Goal

Primary goal:

```text
Push KWS/entity recall toward 0.90.
```

Secondary goal:

```text
Keep CER as low as possible.
```

Entity Recall is the primary metric for the hotword/contextual-biasing goal. CER, Hotword Only CER, Hotword Sentence CER, and WER are guardrail metrics. A recall gain is not automatically acceptable if CER or WER degrades too much.

## Current Best Accepted Result

The current accepted CB-Whisper-side improvement is nested long-hotword promotion.

Approximate accepted metrics:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Entity Recall | 0.8486 |
| CER | 0.0820 |
| Hotword Only CER | 0.1081 |
| WER | 0.5149 |

This is only a small gain over baseline, but it improves recall and guardrail metrics at the same time, so it is kept for now.

## Useful Baseline Reference

Baseline metrics before accepted improvements:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Entity Recall | 0.8475 |
| CER | 0.0822 |
| Hotword Only CER | 0.1087 |
| WER | 0.5161 |

Oracle n-best diagnostics showed limited headroom in the original candidate pool, so large recall gains may require improving candidate availability or changing selection in a way that does not harm CER.

## Experiment Bookkeeping Rules

After every code or config change:

```text
Commit the change to git.
```

After every experiment:

```text
Record the result in README.md and compare it with the previous run and the best accepted run.
```

If a route performs poorly:

1. Try a reasonable fix if the result suggests the direction still has value.
2. If the route remains poor or violates constraints, record the result.
3. Revert the experimental code/config changes.
4. Keep the logs and README record so the failed route remains documented.

## Important Log Files

Main result files:

```text
src/logs/test_metrics.csv
src/logs/runtime_probe.jsonl
src/logs/oracle_nbest_detail_aishell.csv
src/logs/oracle_nbest_summary_aishell.csv
```

Experiment stdout logs are kept under:

```text
src/logs/experiment_*_stdout.log
```

## Lessons From Recent Experiments

- Simple static rerank weight changes did not improve metrics.
- Broader prompt or rescore keyword budgets can hurt CER and recall.
- Decoder hotword bias can improve recall slightly, but tends to damage CER/WER if not tightly constrained.
- Prefix-only hotword bias improved some guardrails but lost recall gains.
- Hard ASR-plausibility guards were too conservative and collapsed recall.
- Candidate exact repair was inactive for current candidate pools.
- Nested long-hotword promotion is useful because it promotes longer competing bias phrases without deleting short true entities.
- Expanding generation candidates to 24 raised recall to about 0.8552 and oracle recall to about 0.8778, but worsened CER and WER and increased runtime. This is useful diagnostically, but not accepted as a final lightweight method in its current form.

## Working Principle

The target is not just a higher number from an ad hoc patch. The target is a defensible CB-Whisper improvement that can be explained in a paper, keeps the KWS model fixed, stays lightweight, improves entity recall, and does not casually sacrifice CER.

## 2026-06-12 Current Context

Current best AISHELL true large-v3 CB-Whisper result:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Entity Recall | 0.9238 |
| CER | 0.0661 |
| Hotword Only CER | 0.0467 |
| WER | 0.4641 |

This result uses the true large-v3 KWS checkpoint:

```text
outputs/aishell_large_v3_kws_true/checkpoints/f1G/f1G-epoch=11-step=72060.ckpt
```

The main accepted diagnosis is that KWS retrieval is no longer the dominant AISHELL bottleneck. The useful direction is making Whisper or the downstream corrector use already-available hotword evidence more effectively.

CB-Whisper + covo bridge status:

- `CBW_EVIDENCE_OUT` in `src/model/cb_whisper.py` exports CB-Whisper evidence JSONL.
- `src/analysis/cbwhisper_covo_bridge.py` converts evidence into Qwen/covo messages and can run the migrated LoRA corrector.
- The bridge injects prompt-side CB-Whisper hotwords by default with `--hotword-source prompt`.
- Broad all-KWS hotword injection is available with `--hotword-source all`, but Pilot100 showed it is noisy.
- Do not add a post-hoc gate/selector for this route. The user explicitly rejected gate-style filtering and prefers retraining/fine-tuning if this route continues.

Pilot100 covo observations:

| Variant | COVO Eval CER | Improved | Worsened | Unchanged |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| No hotword bridge, accept all Qwen rewrites | 0.09073 | 23 | 28 | 49 |
| All KWS hotwords injected | 0.09856 | 22 | 34 | 44 |
| Prompt-side hotwords injected | 0.08486 | 23 | 27 | 50 |

The prompt-side hotword result is the only useful no-gate signal so far, but it was evaluated with a covo LoRA that was not trained on CB-Whisper hotword evidence.

Hotword-aware SFT probe:

- Added `src/analysis/prepare_covo_hotword_sft.py`.
- It converts existing covo ChineseHP/AISHELL rewrite data into the same prompt style used by the CB-Whisper bridge.
- It creates synthetic prompt-side positive hotword evidence from the reference/local edit span and optional confusable KWS-like negatives from N-best.
- Generated local probe files:

```text
cbwhisper_covo_migration_20260609_tar_extracted/covo/data/processed/chinesehp_aishell1/train_cbwhisper_hotword_probe.qwen.jsonl  # 2000 rows
cbwhisper_covo_migration_20260609_tar_extracted/covo/data/processed/chinesehp_aishell1/dev_cbwhisper_hotword_probe.qwen.jsonl    # 500 rows
```

Training probe attempt:

```text
output dir: cbwhisper_covo_migration_20260609_tar_extracted/covo/outputs/qwen35_cbwhisper_hotword_probe_120steps
log:        cbwhisper_covo_migration_20260609_tar_extracted/covo/outputs/logs/qwen35_cbwhisper_hotword_probe_120steps_train.log
base:       cbwhisper_covo_migration_20260609_tar_extracted/models/Qwen3.5-4B
adapter:    cbwhisper_covo_migration_20260609_tar_extracted/covo/outputs/qwen35_text_rewrite_hardneg_dropout_lora_2epoch
```

The first run did not start training because QLoRA loading failed:

```text
ImportError: Using `bitsandbytes` 4-bit quantization requires bitsandbytes: `pip install -U bitsandbytes>=0.46.1`
```

Next choices:

1. Install `bitsandbytes>=0.46.1` in `/root/autodl-tmp/great` and rerun the 120-step QLoRA probe.
2. Retry without `--qlora` using bf16 LoRA, since Qwen3.5-4B should likely fit on the 32 GB RTX 5090 for a short run.

Keep this route lightweight and paper-clean: fine-tune the downstream corrector to use predicted hotword evidence, rather than adding hand-written gates.
